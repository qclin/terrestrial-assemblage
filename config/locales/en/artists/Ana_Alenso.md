**Ana Alenso**

_Liquid agreement_ (2021)

Site specific installation with the following materials: hoses, stainless steel, scaffolding parts, water pumps

The installation proposes an exercise in deconstruction based on the models of polluting machines used in the gold mines of the Amazon in South America. Through the appropriation and transformation of certain industrial elements, new mechanisms are created with the intention of moving and giving novel dimensions to the concept of water as a universal element. The starting point is the interest in exploring the capacity of water to move through, transform and dilute multiple physical barriers, as well as the understanding that its degeneration and contamination are mostly the result of cyclical, industrial and semi-industrial processes that cause an increasingly visible _slow violence_
_# 1_. From this type of violence – immersed and incarnated in the needs of modern society – a critical zone emerges that exposes the accumulation of desires, conflicts and entities that can coexist in a territory. One could say that this offshore installation reveals the boundaries between art and nature at Floating ~~University~~ Berlin: a _Liquid Agreement_ that proposes a dialogue with its surroundings and expands through the collective imaginary and its possible multidimensionality.

**Ana Alenso** (Berlin) builds an allegorical cosmos showcasing the economic, social and ecological risks and the imbalance implicit in extractive practices of our natural resources. Her work departs from the assumption that within the fragile state of geopolitics and the vulnerabilities of our societies and natural reserves, artistic practices become modulators of a widespread sense of uncertainty. Instead of rejecting this uncertainty, she identifies with it and embraces it as a vehicle for prototyping and experimentation.
