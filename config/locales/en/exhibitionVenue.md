In 2018, [Floating ~~University~~ Berlin](https://www.floatinguniversity.org/) was initiated by _raumlabor_ as a temporary inner-city laboratory for collective, experiential learning and transdisciplinary exchange. The site was designed in the early 1930s as a rainwater retention basin to serve the Tempelhof airfield and adjacent avenues, and it still remains a fully functioning infrastructure today. Having being closed off to the public for over 60 years, a diverse range of flora and fauna have taken root and given birth to a unique landscape: a man-made environment reclaimed by ecosystems, coexisting within the relatively new presence of this pedagogical experiment, forming a nature-culture or a third landscape.
