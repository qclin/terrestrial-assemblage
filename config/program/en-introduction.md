Artists\* and scientists\* present their interdisciplinary projects on the environment in border zones. Positions on the symbiotic relationship between nature and borders will be shown and discussed. Examples of this are the _European Green Belt_, the ecological network along the former Iron Curtain over more than 12,500 kilometres from the Barents Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, _the demilitarised zone (DMZ)_ on the Korean peninsula, which has not allowed human access for 70 years and _the\_\_Lower Jordan River_, whose rehabilitation and regeneration is initiated and being implemented by the environmental activists from Jordan, Israel and Palestine \_(EcoPeace Middle East).\_Also international artists will present their interdisciplinary practices on art and nature between and on the borders. Along the axes of territoriality and deterritorialization, artists\* and scientists\* will speak on current ecological issues on borderlines from multiple perspectives and create new spaces for thinking.

The symposium is made possible by the kind support of the Korean Cultural Center Berlin, the Hanns Seidel Foundation and the Bund f√ºr Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland e.V. (BUND).
