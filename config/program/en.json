      "description": "'Nature' knows no manmade borders. This becomes particularly obvious when migratory birds cross the border at the Demilitarized Zone between the Republic of Korea in the South and the Democratic People´s Republic of Korea in the North. The Korean Peninsula is of great importance for the biodiversity in the region due to its central location on the East-Asian Australasian Flyway. But the country north of the Demilitarized Zone is also one of the most isolated countries on earth. While globalization has created bridges between many places—often also between formerly hostile states—the DPRK remained isolated. In this context, the idea of a Demilitarized Zone Peace Park has been mooted for a long time (Kim 1997, Brady 2008; Park, 2013). But the practical initiatives on the ground already went further. Since 2015, the Hanns Seidel Foundation has been committed, to bring the actors in North Korea, especially the Ministry of Environment and Land Protection, together with representatives of international organizations and national governments. Dr. Bernhard Seliger, Representative of Hanns Seidel Foundaition Korea, presents the projects of the last two decades both in North Korea and in the border area in South Korea, where the tragedy of division coexists with biodiversity. \n\r\n\r Dr. Bernhard J. Seliger is resident representative of Hanns Seidel Foundation (HSF) in Korea, based in Seoul. HSF aims to promote peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. Since 2003 he travels to North Korea to implement projects focusing on environment conservation and cooperation. From 2014 he was also involved in two projects on sustainable reforestation and wetlands conservation. Other topics included organic agriculture and the clean development mechanism.",

      "description": "The Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) was established in the course of the post-war order and has become a 'magic tool' to prevent armed conflict. It is also a code with which modern Korean history can be read. The DMZ on the Korean Peninsula is very different in character from demilitarised zones in other countries. It is there to secure peace, and in doing so it is the place with the most weapons in the world. It shapes the Korean present, it is brutal and bizarre, and at any time it is capable of throwing international relations into chaos from one moment to the next. The DMZ ecosystem is one of the three ecological 'central axes' on the Korean peninsula, which, together with the Baekdudaegan Mountains and the coastal wetlands, connects the east and west. This ecological space is characterised by a great diversity of species that exist in different overlapping topographic zones. Kim Seung Ho, Director of the DMZ Ecology Research Institute, presents the ecological value of the DMZ as a common asset of the two Koreas, explains the guiding principle of the South Korean government's DMZ policy to date and its impact on the ecosystem, and concludes by describing how, in his view, the DMZ could be used as a tool for peace.",

      "speaker": "Shira Wachsmann",
      "description": "War trauma and possibly all trauma can be seen as a particular set of scars shaped by memory, fear, identity and politics [Judith Herman, m.d., 2015]. A re-positioning of those scars can reveal not only how their intensity operates in the discourse but also sheds light on how the mechanisms of creating knowledge, identity and meaning are formed [Foucault, 1972]. Exploring the unspoken zone where memory, amnesia and trauma of war are embodied, preserved and circulated in different shapes, patterns and forms that create atmosphere. The effect of trauma is the opposite of linear time. The past is projected into the future coming back to create the present, creating a fluid environment that allows the living trauma to take shape and circulate [Pierre Klossowski, 1970] [Christina Sharpe, 2016]. The moment before is a term Wachsmann coined in order to work time, trauma and event in a different way than the linear time events we normally use. The moment before is a fragment, diffraction and the becoming of the unfolding event [Karen Barad, 2014]. The moment before is not only leading to the explosion; but also has the ability to change the event, change the shape or the way that the event/trauma unfolds and circulates.\r\n\r\nIn her work, [Shira Wachsmann](/artist?id=Shira_Wachsmann) (Berlin, London) explores the multi-layered notions of 'land' as a natural and cultural habitat. She mainly uses organic materials such as earth, metal, coal, straw and plants and deals with their religious, historical and social content. Shira Wachsmann confronts the viewer with philosophical ideas and political ideologies, thereby addressing concepts of home and the construction of identity. In her most recent artistic research, Wachsmann deals with the perceptive capacity and memory of plants.\n\r\n\r[website](www.shirawachsmann.com)",

      "description": "The European Green Belt forms an ecological network of over 12,500 kilometres across Europe, stretching along the former Iron Curtain from the Barents Sea in the far north to the Mediterranean south of Europe to the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea. The European Green Belt features an extraordinary diversity of animals and plants. However, it also represents a unique memorial landscape to the overcoming of the Cold War. Of the 24 riparian states, 20 have already officially committed themselves to the protection and further development of this important ecological corridor through a political declaration of intent. Dr. Liana Geidezis, Head of BUND's Green Belt Department, will present the transformation process of the former border strip along the former Iron Curtain into an ecology network after the fall of the Wall, as well as BUND's commitment to the nomination of the European Green Belt as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Iron Curtain in 2019. The basis for this is a research project from 2014 commissioned by BfN (German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation), in which nomination scenarios for the European Green Belt were examined based on the UNESCO criteria. The study recommends a nomination as a 'mixed site', i.e. natural and cultural heritage site, and a transboundary serial designation with a nomination process in several phases. It is anticipated that the nomination process will take several years and will require close cooperation between nature conservation and cultural representatives, historians, and monument conservationists.\r\n\r\n Dr. Liana Geidezis studied biology with a focus on zoology at the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, 1998 doctorate on feeding ecology of free-living river otters (Lutra lutra) in the Upper Lusatian pond landscape; research assistant at the University of Erlangen and the Environmental Research Centre (UFZ) Leipzig. Since 1998, head of the international BUND project Green Belt, which is responsible for the German and Central European Green Belt (regional coordination) with the department in Nuremberg. Since 2014, board member of the European Green Belt Association e.V., which acts as the umbrella organisation for the Green Belt Europe.",

      "speaker": "Melanie Kreutz",
      "organization": "BUND Department Green Belt",
      "description": "The Green Belt must be understood in the triad of nature-culture-history. Only the overall view justifies its designation as a National Nature Monument, the demand to nominate it as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, explains its importance, its high esteem by the public and its unbroken media presence even after 30 years. The inner-German border claimed numerous lives and caused great personal suffering, e.g. through the destruction of villages and the forced resettlement of thousands of people. In the euphoria of the fall of the Wall, hardly any thought was given to monument protection, so that border fortifications were dismantled in an unorganized manner just a few days after the fall of the Wall. The 1,393 km long Green Belt Germany is a visible and comprehensible structure in the landscape that allows the spatial extent of the border installations - and in most places also their characteristic structure - to be reconstructed and links individual memorial sites and relics with one another. Since the inhumane border installations paradoxically allowed nature to survive, the preservation of the Green Belt thus inseparably includes that of the border relics. Melanie Kreuz, BUND Green Belt Department, presents the increasing importance of the Green Belt as a memorial landscape, the experience of the Green Belt for locals and tourists, as well as the commitment of BUND to make memorial sites in the Green Belt continuously visible.",

      "description": "Kyung Jin Zoh presents his personal experiences and memories related to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). His relationship with the DMZ began when he coordinated the establishment of the so-called DMZ Peace Town in Cheorwon. This was a community design project to build a centre for migratory birds. Through this, Zoh developed a deeper interest in the DMZ and border areas. He undertook several  landscape researches related to Cheorwon, which led him to engage with the DMZ in art projects. In his lecture, he explains the background of his art projects, among them the Observatory Project, an artistic research on the border in which he discovered hidden ruined landscapes of the Cold War. In addition to this project, Zoh will show other curatorial works and conclude by raising questions about possible future plans in relation to the DMZ. \r\n\r\n Melanie Kreutz studied landscape planning with a focus on landscape ecology at University of Kassel.

Through movement and performance, Jordan gives materiality another dimension – she builds motorized sculptures and creates edible landscapes. Her sculptures are intended to draw the viewer into the present and open a dialogue between natural phenomena, philosophy and art. Jordan opens up doors to a universe where she humorously and romantically creates machines that juxtapose robotic consciousness with organic cyclic decay and life. She raises questions about “agency” and encourages a change of perspective. She shifts the focus away from humans towards the entire ecology.\n\r\n\r[website](https://dukhee.de)",
